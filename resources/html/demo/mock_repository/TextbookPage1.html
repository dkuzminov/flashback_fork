  <h2>Recognizing and Using Nouns</h2>
  <h3>GENDER</h3>
  <p>Like English, all Spanish nouns have a number: singular (one), as in la
familia, or plural (more than one), as in las familias. Unlike English,
however, all Spanish nouns also have a gender: masculine or feminine. In
some instances, the gender of the noun is blatantly obvious: <spot id=spot1>un hombre</spot>
(a man) is masculine, whereas <spot id=spot2>una mujer</spot> (a woman) is feminine. In other
cases, the gender of a noun is not in the least bit apparent and defies all
rules of common sense or logic: <spot id=spot3>una corbata</spot> (a tie) is feminine, while <spot id=spot3>un
vestido</spot> (a dress) is masculine.</p>
  <p>Spanish syntax and grammar require that all words in a sentence
agree in number and gender with the noun or pronoun they modify. For
this reason, you must learn the gender of each noun you need or deem
important. Special noun endings and markers, either articles or adjectives,
indicate the gender and number of Spanish nouns.</p>

  <h3>NOUN MARKERS</h3>
  <p>Noun markers are articles or adjectives that tell you whether a noun is
singular (sing.) or plural (pl.), masculine (m.) or feminine (f.). Three of
the most common markers, as shown in the following table, are definite
articles expressing “the,” indefinite articles expressing “a,” “an,” “one,”
or “some,” and demonstrative adjectives expressing “this,” “that,”
“these,” and “those.”</p>
